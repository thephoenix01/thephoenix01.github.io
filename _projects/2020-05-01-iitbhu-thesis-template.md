## Building your thesis

### Using an IDE (such as TexStudio/TexMaker)

When starting a new session, compile and run (order specified below) `thesis-template.tex` first. After this, running/building any of the individual tex files you are currently working would render the complete document.

Set the following build order on your IDE for the desired results.

    pdflatex
    bibtex
    pdflatex
    pdflatex
    view-pdf-internal

### Online, using Overleaf, ShareLatex, or Authorea

Set `thesis-template.tex` as the primary document and compile.

### Using command line interface (Unix/Linux/Windows)

*Work under progress, will be updated soon.*
